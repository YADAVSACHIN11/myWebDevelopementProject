This all about the <br> taggs in the paragraph tag(<P><?P>).

Inserts a line break without starting a new paragraph. This tag is used for line breaks that are part of the content, 
such as in poems or addresses. For example, in poetry, line breaks are usually fixed. The <br> tag is a singleton tag, 
meaning it has no end tag. In HTML, it is not required to use a final slash ( <br />). 


<p>
Creates a paragraph and separates text into distinct blocks. 
The <p> tag automatically creates some space before and after itself. 
You can specify the space in a style sheet or the browser will automatically apply it.
