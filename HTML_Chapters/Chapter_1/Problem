This is all about the Heading and the paragraph tags.

#Heading

      HTML headings are defined by HTML tags and are used to organize content and help users and search engines understand the page.
Here are some things to know about HTML headings: 

Types of headings

      There are six types of headings, H1 through H6, with H1 being the most important and H6 the least important. 
      H1 tag
         The H1 tag is used to designate the main heading of a webpage. It should be placed at the top of the page and be relevant to the content. 
      H3 tag
         The H3 tag is used for subcategories or subsections under H2 tags. It can be used to highlight key arguments, introduce examples, or present different perspectives

#Paragraph

    A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
